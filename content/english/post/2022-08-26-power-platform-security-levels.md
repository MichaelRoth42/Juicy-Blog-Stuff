## Path to working in an environment

"But I can't see the environment!"

Are your familiar with that sentence? I hear user complain that they can't see environments, as well as admins that they can't see user in the environments user list.

If you want a user to work on an environment there are three things to consider (depending on the kind of environment, but basically it's like this):

1. Licensing
2. Security groups
3. Security roles

Depending on which of these a user has, they have access up to different stages. I will go through each of these stages and demonstrate the user experience, as well as the admin experience. That gives you the opportunity to determine, what your users need for which scenario. Should or shouldn't they see that environment? After this post you know how to set all components up to be in control.

For our scenario we try to add users to a production/sandbox environment with a database and an added security group. Be aware that different environments work differently, especially the default environment (more on that later).

We have three users:
User A - Isaiah Langer - Microsoft E5 license without the Power Platform Apps

User B - Henrietta Mueller - Microsoft E5 license with the Power Platform Apps included

User C - Joni Sherman - Microsoft E5 license with the Power Platform Apps included and she is part of the Security group "Super Secure"

## Scenario A: No license, no security group, no security role

When we log in as Isaiah Langer we can't see any of the Power Platform products listed under apps on [www.office.com](www.office.com).

When we directly go to [make.powerapps.com](make.powerapps.com) we only see the default environment (which is called Personal Productivity in my tenant ðŸ˜‰).

As an Administrator we don't see Isaiah in the list of users of our environment and if we try to add him, we get an error message.

## Scenario B: No security group, no security role

When we log is as Henrietta we can see the Power Platform products Power Apps, Power Automate as well as Power BI on [www.office.co](www.office.com).

When we go to [make.powerapps.com](make.powerapps.com) we can see the default environment as well as her personal developer environment. That's due to the fact that we gave her the Microsoft Power Apps for Developer license.

As an administrator we can already see Henrietta in the user list of the environment, despite we haven't actively added her yet.

![Image that shows a list of all users of the environment, including Henrietta](/images/SecurityLevels_8.png)

The reason for that is simple:
> every licensed user is automatically added to every environment.

Henrietta is added to the environment, but she isn't part of the security group, nor has she a security role to access any resources within the environment. When we try to assign a security role to her, we get an error message and see what's happening in the background. User get added to an environment, but when the environment has a security group, the user get set on "disabled".

![Image that shows an error message, saying "Failed to assign role 'Basic User': roleFailureDuetoUserIsDisabled"](/images/SecurityLevels_9.png)

Even though users are added automatically by having a license, they can't see the environment until they get a security role. You can't even assign a security role, when they're disabled due to not being in the right security group.

Hint: Sometimes you don't see users in a newly created environment. Usually you can see them after their next log in, when they visit the [maker portal](www.make.powerapps.com)

## Scenario C: No security role

When we log in as Joni, we have the same user experience as with Henrietta. We can see the default environment as well as the development environment, but not the environment which was secured with a security group.

>Being member of the security group doesn't reveal the environment to you

From an administrator point of view, nothing as changed yet either. But when we select her and assign her a security role, we don't get an error message, since she isn't set to "disabled".
