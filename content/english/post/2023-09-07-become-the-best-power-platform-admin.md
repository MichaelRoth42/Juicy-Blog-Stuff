In the next section, we'll explore valuable resources and references that can aid you in your journey as a Power Platform administrator.

## Resources
> **The best resource is your own knowledge. I believe in you ❤️**

Sounds cringe? Good, then I have your attention:

The best documentation is the one you write yourself. 

> Everybody loves to read good documentation, but nobody likes to write good documentation 

🤷‍♂️

Yet you need two things when working as a Power Platform Administrator:
### Technical governance document
This is the document for the documentation of the whole settings. What have you configured in which way and why? This is going to be a long document, but it’s worth it to write it all down. The future-you will thank you for that. 
I usually use a template, so I don’t forget anything. Maybe you can find some inspiration in [mine](https://github.com/MichaelRoth42/EPPC23/blob/main/Governance%20Document%20Template.docx) 😉

### User faced documentation
User won’t read a long word document with technical phrases and specifications, and if you don’t want to explain again and again how Power Platform is used in your organization, do yourself a favour and set up a user-friendly documentation. 
The fastest and best way I found is the [Power Platform Hub from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/guidance/adoption/wiki-community). It’s a one-stop shop for makers to find out everything they need about getting started with Microsoft Power Platform. It’s a SharePoint Site Collection that is a perfect framework for you to explain your Power Platform governance strategy to users. 
It’s a PowerShell file for you to deploy, so usually it’s set up in a couple of minutes 😃

## Additional Tips and Best Practices
Let me close with a few tips and best practices that have been proven in the past:

### Stay informed
The Platform evolves rapidly and it’s almost impossible to get all the news and features that are developed. A good starting point is the Power Platform Weekly Newsletter:
[Power Platform Weekly](https://www.ppweekly.com/)
It covers the latest articles, videos, podcasts, events and other publications around the Power Platform. Another cool feature are their Persona Icons, which let you quickly discover which publications are for you.

### Never Stop Learning
It’s the logical follow up from the point above: when you stay informed, you need to learn about all the new things coming out. I recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/powerplatform/) (it’s a no brainer, d’oh), but also the community. [EY](https://twitter.com/TheCRMNinja) aka the CRM Ninja has a [fantastic blog](https://thecrm.ninja/) that covers administrator topics every now and then, as well as [Carsten Groth](https://twitter.com/carsten_growth). He’s EMEA Global Blackbelt Senior Technical Specialist (that’s a mouthful) and also runs an [amazing blog](https://carstengroth.wordpress.com/).
And you should check the blog from [Forward Forever](https://forwardforever.com/blog/), where [Antti Pajunen](https://twitter.com/anttipajunen), [Jukka Niiranen](https://twitter.com/jukkan) and their Team blog about Power Platform stuff. They often cover administrational topics and it’s by far the best blog out there. I salute you 🫡

### User Feedback
Actively get feedback from your users and give them a channel for that too. Understand their pain points, requirements and even their suggestions for improvement. 
Think of it as your secret sauce for success. Instead of waiting for feedback to come to you, create a feedback-friendly environment. Be proactive and set up channels for users to share their thoughts and experiences with the platform. Whether it's a simple feedback form or a dedicated email address, make sure they know their voices are heard. Plus, don't forget to celebrate their wins! When a user builds an impressive app or workflow, give them a virtual high-five. Encourage a culture of collaboration and recognition, and you'll see the Power Platform community within your organization thrive.


## The End
By incorporating these additional tips and best practices into your daily routines and strategies, you can further elevate your role as a Power Platform Administrator. Your dedication to continuous improvement and commitment to best practices will help drive the success of the Power Platform within your organization.

In conclusion, remember that your role as an administrator is dynamic and ever-evolving. Embrace new challenges, stay adaptable, and continue to explore opportunities to optimize and enhance the Power Platform for your organization's benefit.
