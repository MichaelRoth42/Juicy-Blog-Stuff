# Think about limiting environment creation

By default every user with a Dataverse license who can access the Power Platform admin center can create new production and sandbox environments, as well as trial environments.

Depending on the way to handle your Citizen Developer and Maker you can either leave this setting as it is, or restrict it. For each type of environment (production and trial) you can decide whether every user should be able to create new ones, or only specific admins.
These specific admins are:

- Global admins
- Dynamics 365 admins
- Power Platform admins

If you have a Power Platform Admin team that has the capacities to create every new environment for the user, this might be a valuable option.
If you don't want to put more work on your admin team and give the maker the possibility to work with the tools you gave them, you can leave the settings as they are.

If you have security considerations, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- you can think of building an approval process that gives the admin team the possibility to approve or deny the creation of a new environment by a user (check the PowerShell possibilities for that, the links are at the end of this blog).
- every environment that is created by a user will be shown in the Center of Excellence, so you don't have a unnoticed wildgrowth of environments.
- For every environment that gets created with a database, 1GB of capacity has to be available so take this into consideration when deciding how to use those settings.

## Capacity allocations

While you think about environment creation, you should consider who will be able to allocate additional capacity to environments. Per default every environment admin is able to do so. I recommend limiting that to "only specific admins" since the capacity allocation can have a huge impact on the performance of your Power Platform. You can create an approval process to allocate capacities to a certain environment, in which an environment admin must specify a business justification.

## How to change the environment creation settings

In the Power Platform admin center, select the cogwheel in the upper right corner and select "Power Platform settings".

Now you can define, who can create production and sandbox environments, trial environments as well as who can allocate add-on capacities.

## Options with PowerShell

You also have the possibilities to limit the creation of environments to admins via PowerShell:

`$settings = @{ DisableEnvironmentCreationByNonAdminUsers = $true }
Set-TenantSettings $settings`

**Attention** for Trial environments you need a separate cmdlet:

`$settings = @{ DisableTrialEnvironmentCreationByNonAdminUsers = $true }
Set-TenantSettings $settings`
