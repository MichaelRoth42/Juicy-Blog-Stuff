### **Intro**

I just managed to pass the Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals PL-900 exam and want to share my experience with you guys. I will show you what kind of learning material I used, what surprised me and what I think is necessary to pass this exam. I hope you will find it helpful ðŸ˜Š

### **Whatâ€™s inside**

The PL-900 certification is the Power Platform Fundamentals certification from Microsoft revolving around everything you need to know to dive deeper into the Power Platform.

Here you can find the content, that will be need on the exam:

[Exam PL-900: Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/pl-900)

Naturally you will expect the four components of the Platform to be part of this:

*   Power Automate
*   Power Apps
*   Power BI
*   Power Virtual Agents

You should be able to explain the basic functions of each product and you should know about the value it can bring.

But watch out, it is helpful, if you worked with the components already. There will be question on functionalities, connectors, how to set up and share services youâ€™ve build and how to handle the data behind you flow/app/report/bot. **Make sure to read the detailed outline of the required skills at the end of this blog** ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

Above that, you should know about the overall busines value of the Power Platform.

A few thing took me by surprise thoughâ€¦

The **_Dynamics365_** content: There were a few questions aiming for Dynamics apps and services that caught me totally off-guard. Now, I know that model driven Power Apps are kind of Dynamics related, yet I never thought that there were D365 questions in a Power Platform exam.

Those **_nitty gritty questions_**: Iâ€™ve experienced this a few times now. Microsoft always throws in a few questions that you can only answer, if youâ€™ve memorized every little detail of every little step you take while working with the Power Platform. Sometimes you must remember every step you need to take in a process, even if in real life this is a guided process. Iâ€™m note really sure where to benefit of knowing the answer to those questions lies, but nevertheless: there are some annoying questions, just be aware of it.

### **Learning Material**

The learning material I list here are the ones that I used to pass the exam. There is a lot more out there and in the end, you have to find out, what kind of learner you are. Iâ€™m just talking from a personal perspective here:

Like with the most certification, Microsoft itself offers a free learning path that covers all the relevant topics: [Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/power-plat-fundamentals/). And this one is really good. I highly recommend to take the real life exercises seriously.

From my understanding a hands-on knowledge on all of the core components of the Platform is crucial. If you have the chance to work with the apps beforehand, do so!

Additionally I watched the Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals course on [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/microsoft-power-platform-fundamentals-pl-900). You will find six videos (each between 1,5 â€“ 2 h) from [Hugo Barona](https://twitter.com/HmsBarona), [Vlad Catrinescu](https://twitter.com/vladcatrinescu), [Ranjan Relan](https://twitter.com/rrelan2) and [Matthew Soucoup](https://twitter.com/CodeMillMatt). They all did a really good job and you will deepend you understanding of the necessary knowledge you gained on the Microsoft Learning Path.

And I canâ€™t emphasize this point enough: make sure you read and understand the detailed outline of the required skills at the end of this blog. I overlooked those waaaaay too often and was caught off-guard. Donâ€™t be like me, be preparedðŸ’ª

### **My impression**

Iâ€™ve worked with every part of the Power Platform on real life examples (except PowerBI, that one is my kryptonite) and after digging through the learning material I didnâ€™t thought this exam would be a big issue.

Well, I passed on first try, nevertheless I canâ€™t say that I pass with glory ðŸ˜… Especially those nitty-gritty questions about sharing and deploying and the Dynamics 365 content made me sweat.

So I think the provided learning material in combination with a few real life exercises are totally sufficient to pass this exam. It worked for me, even if I didnâ€™t ace it. But in the end, who cares?

You wonâ€™t need in depth knowledge about security, compliance, licensing or any other of those nasty topics. If you know your basics (including some D365 stuff) you are good to go.
