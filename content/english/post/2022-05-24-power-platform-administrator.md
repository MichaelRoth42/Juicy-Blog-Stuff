# Designate Power Platform Administrator

When it comes to administer the Power Platform you want to designate a Power Platform Administrator. This role has the ability to manage everything around the platform at the tenant level, without having as much rights as the Global Administrator.

## Why consider a Power Platform Administrator?

Let me begin with something very important, we need to understand: if we want to implement and use the Power Platform in our organization, the administrative effort is quite high at the beginning. Too much for regular IT to do on the side. If we put it on top of your regular IT/Admin teams workload, that is simply too much.

Microsoft advises to come up even with a whole team, which depends on the size of your organization, but may be worth considering. Let's check the most important tasks on a Power Platform Admin's list:

- establish and maintain an environment strategy
- set up data loss prevention policies
- managing security groups and assign users
- take care about the capacity and licensing
- make data available to makers
- handle integration and migration
- handle security
- monitor makers efforts

Does that sound like a long list do you? Exactly that is why we should consider a separate Power Platform Admin, if not a whole team.

A designated admin might increase the chance of your makers working in a well structured environment with clear rules. That lead to fast learning makers, which makes their projects develop faster, being more efficient and ultimately them make better decisions.

## How to assign the role?

You can assign this role in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

In the "Users" menu, select "Active users". Then select the user you want to assign the Power Platform Admin role to.

Select "Manage roles", then "Admin center access" and finally expand the menu by selecting "Show all by category".

You will find the Power Platform Administrator role with a little infobox, describing the access to Microsoft Dynamics 365, PowerApps, data loss prevention policies, and Power Automate.
Select the box to assign the role.

>Don't confuse the Power Platform Administrator with with Environment Administrator. The Environment Administrator is the administrator of a certain environment, the Power Platform Administrator ist the administrator of the whole Power Platform in the tenant. I will explain the Environment Administrator in the blog "Environment Strategies".

## Power Platform Admin Center

There are different ways to get to the Power Platform Admin Center (often abbreviated to ppac):

1. In the Microsoft 365 Admin center select "All admin centers" on the left pane and then select "Power Apps" or "Power Automate" to get directed to the Power Platform Admin center.
2. When you're on the [Microsoft Flow Homepage](www.flow.microsoft.com) or in the [Power Apps studio](www.make.powerapps.com), you can select the cogwheel in the upper right corner, then you find the link to the admin center.
3. You can type "aka.ms/ppac" in your browser

Please know that every user with a Dataverse license is able to access the Power Platform Admin Center (through the ways #2 and #3). They can only see the environments they are members of and can only access the resources they are authorized to access.

In the next chapters of the basic category you will find a few settings that are important, since every user with a license is able to access the Power Platform Admin Center.

## Low-code strategy team

Since we're on it we should think about something else regarding the Power Platform Admin. Every Administrator will thank you, if their task list is based on the organizational strategy and goals. They implement measures to reach the goals and they prefer to do it in a structured way (remember me saying that Administrator hate to put out fires unexpectedly?).

The way Power Platform fits into our strategical goals, our IT landscape and in our culture needs to be decided by key decision maker who know the big picture. Don't let your admins come up with something like that, it's not their job. Gather a team from the business the IT and from the management to think about cross organizational collaboration and how a low code platform will improve it.
