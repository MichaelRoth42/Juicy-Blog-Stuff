## Why monitoring matters

As discussed in my [Power Platform governance - setting the scene](https://www.michaelroth42.com/post/2022-05-08-power-platform-governance-part-0/) blog, bad governance can lead to a growing Shadow IT. The term describes when users solve problems with IT apps and services that are not approved or even known by the IT department. That usually happens because they don't get the support they need, being from the IT or other departments. That also happens when governance is too strict and users feel the need to come up with their own solutions and start using 3rd party tools.

>> People will always find a way to solve problems

Power Platform is a brilliant way to solve the Shadow IT problem, since you give you makers a platform and all the tools they need in their belt to build awesome stuff. Additionally you can monitor what's going on in your tenant.



Clarity: Get an overview over what's happening in your tenant

Safety: Keep critical infrastructure safe

Improvability: Manage your adoption journey to get the most out of the platform to understand your ROI

Think about what information you want to have and for what purpose. Most of the data reports are generated just ti be generated. It gives you the false sense of security, but if you don't analyze and use that data, it just lures you in and eats up all your capacity. Remember: saving monitoring data costs storage space.
