## Definition - What is Citizen Development?
The Low Code Revolution allows companies of all sizes to innovate and drive digitalization continuously to let their busines thrive. Employees with basic knowledge of spreadsheets and databases can build workflows and even applications to meet business needs in their personal work environment. 

The idea is not new, over years have Excel Power User create almost database/apps with their own makros in Excel. Low Code app development is very similar. Giving the user the ability to solve problems and optimize work processes is something we do since a long time.

Citizen Developer or Maker are employees who find and implement solutions. 

They change from being passive user to become an active Maker. Low Code Platforms like the Power Platform gives the possibility to create solutions using the whole Microsoft 365 apps and services suite.

This means, giving the tools and abilities to solve problems right where they appear: at the workfield of the subject matter experts. Nobody knows the unique workflows better than the employers who work on a daily basis with those workflows. If they are able to optimize and digitalize those workflows, you gain a very powerful group of employers. If somebody from the IT department wanted to optimize those workflows you’d need to have workshops and meetings to explain the subject, the challenge and how a solution might look like. And in those meetings two different kind of people, IT- and business, who not necessarily speak the same language, try to find a common ground to develop a solution. If the business doesn’t need to explain or even better, is able to show a simple workflow/app that leads to a common ground of understanding. 

>Laura Graham-Brown: "[Citizen Developer]…are trained on what cannot be googled"

By enabling your staff to address the needs of their department on their own, you create the possibility for your IT department to work on more complex challenges and maintain governance, security and the overall oversight.
